<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->
**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `openspec/AGENTS.md` (located inside the `openspec/` directory—run `ls openspec` or `openspec update` if you don't see it) if you need additional OpenSpec conventions or clarifications.

**Steps**
Track these steps as TODOs and complete them one by one.
1. **Start Learning Monitoring**:
   - The system automatically monitors the implementation process.
   - Captures errors and solutions.
   - Extracts effective code patterns.
2. Read `changes/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and `tasks.md` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
3. Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the requested change.
4. Confirm completion before updating statuses—make sure every item in `tasks.md` is finished.
5. Update the checklist after all work is done so each task is marked `- [x]` and reflects reality.
6. Reference `openspec list` or `openspec show <item>` when additional context is required.
7.  **Automated Learning and Knowledge Update**:
    - The system automatically analyzes the complete change.
    - Extracts system-level insights.
    - Updates top-level insights in CLAUDE.md.

**Reference**
- Use `openspec show <id> --json --deltas-only` if you need additional context from the proposal while implementing.
